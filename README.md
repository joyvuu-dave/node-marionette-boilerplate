# Node/Marionete boilerplate

This is a boilerplate project structure for Node.js and Marionette.js application.

It aims to provide a base for starting a new application saving you from the
cumbersome setup and wiring-up everything from the start every time. Instead, just
clone this boilerplate and work off of it.

You will get a base structure for application files organization, together
with a Grunt build script that manages building a client-side application and
preparing it to be served by the Node server, as well as running tests for
both client-side Marionette.js and server-side Node.js application.

*This boilerplate is just a personal toolchain extracted from the project I've
been working on, allowing me to both explore Grunt plugins and kick-off 
new projects more easily. For a more advanced toolset and workflow, check
[Yeoman.io](http://yeoman.io/) project which does a lot more than this boilerplate.*
